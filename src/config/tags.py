# Project-specific tags/drops should not be defined globally.
#
# Instead, store tags/drops as part of each project's data structure (e.g., in the project folder or project file).
# Example usage:
# project_data = {
#     "name": "Project A",
#     "tags": ["Tag1", "Tag2", "Facade"],
#     "drops": ["Drop1", "Drop2"],
#     # ... other project fields ...
# }
